Create a REST API using flask-restx for user registration (no authentication)
    - Data validations
        - email
        - password & confirm password are the same
        - etc
Implement the functionality for "confirm email" as well

(Optional)
http://localhost/register

    the link (url) for confirming the registration
    the user is considered to be "registered" only when the above url is visited
