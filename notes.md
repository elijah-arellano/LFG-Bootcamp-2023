    - SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
        There has to be ONLY one reason for the code to change

    - OCP (Open Closed Principle)
        Any code that is tested & released MUST be treated as 'closed' (frozen) for modification, but 'open' for extension (by adding new code)
        
    - LSP (Liskov's Substitution Principle)
    - ISP (Interface Segregation Principle)
    - DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle)
